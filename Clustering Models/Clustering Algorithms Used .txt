We will use the following clustering models to test them on the datasets:
1. K-means
2. AgglomerativeClustering
3. DBSCAN
4. SpectralClustering


This project aims to use the course studied clustering models that have been presented. 
The used dataset is articles dataset which consists of the following:
1. Business Dataset: 2000 articles
2. Education Dataset: 2000 articles
3. Entertainment Dataset: 2000 article
4. Sports Dataset: 2000 article
5. Technology Dataset: 2000 article

These datasets add up to 10,000 articles that we can divided using stratified random sampling to create a smaller dataset consisting of a thousand article.
